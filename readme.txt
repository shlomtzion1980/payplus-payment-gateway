Plugin Disclaimer:
PayPlus does not accept liability for any damage, loss, cost (including legal costs), expenses, indirect losses or consequential damage of any kind which may be suffered or incurred by the user from the use of this service.

It is important to know that this plugin relies on third-party services.
However, the third-party so mentioned is the PayPlus core engine at their servers - the providers of this plugin.

By being a payment processor, just like many of its kind, it must send some transaction details to the third-party server (itself) for token generation and transaction logging statistics and connecting to invoices.

It is this transfer back and forth of data between your WooCommerce and the PayPlus servers that we would like to bring to your attention clearly and plainly.
